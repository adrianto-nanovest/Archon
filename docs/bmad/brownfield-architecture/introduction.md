# Introduction

This document captures the **CURRENT STATE** of the Archon codebase as of October 2025, including technical realities, architectural patterns, and integration points. It serves as a definitive reference for AI agents and developers working on the Confluence Knowledge Base integration and other enhancements.

## Document Scope

**Primary Focus:** Confluence Knowledge Base Integration using Direct API + Hybrid Database Schema

**Enhancement Context:**
- Integrating 4000+ Confluence Cloud pages into Archon's RAG system
- Direct Confluence API approach (NOT Google Drive intermediary)
- Hybrid schema: Dedicated `confluence_pages` metadata table + unified `archon_crawled_pages` chunks
- 90% code reuse leveraging existing document storage and search infrastructure
- Expected implementation: 1.5-2 weeks

**Secondary Coverage:** Current system architecture, recent changes (Aug-Oct 2025), and technical constraints
