# Implementation Summary

**Timeline**: ~12 working days across 3 weeks
**Total Stories**: 26 stories across 6 epics
**Story Distribution**: Epic 1 (4 stories), Epic 2 (5 stories), Epic 3 (5 stories), Epic 4 (3 stories), Epic 5 (4 stories), Epic 6 (5 stories)

**Architectural Revision**: Epic 2 split into two epics after comprehensive HTML processing analysis revealed HTML to Markdown processing is epic-sized work (~2,100 lines across 18 files). Separation enables parallel development and independent testing.

**Dependency Flow**:
```
Epic 1: Database Foundation & API Client (Days 1-2.5)
  ├─→ Epic 2: HTML to Markdown Content Processing (Days 3-5)
  │     └─→ Epic 3: Incremental Sync & Chunk Management (Days 6-7)
  │           └─→ Epic 4: Metadata-Enhanced Search (Days 8-9)
  └─→ Epic 5: Frontend UI & UX (Days 10-11)
          ↓
      Epic 6: Testing, Performance & Documentation (Days 12-13)
```

**Risk Mitigation Built Into Stories**:
- Every story includes Integration Verification steps ensuring existing system integrity
- Atomic chunk updates (Story 3.2) guarantee zero-downtime search availability
- Performance validation (Story 6.3) validates NFRs before production
- Comprehensive testing (Stories 6.1-6.2) validates all integration points

**Key Implementation Notes**:
1. **90% Code Reuse**: Stories 3.1, 3.4, 4.1 leverage existing services without modification
2. **Modular Architecture**: Epic 2 implements 18 focused handlers (~2,100 lines) for RAG-optimized content processing
3. **Brownfield Safety**: All database changes additive (migration 010), existing tables unchanged
4. **Incremental Value**: Each epic delivers working functionality independently
5. **Metadata-First Search**: Stories 4.1-4.2 implement mandatory metadata enrichment per requirements validation
