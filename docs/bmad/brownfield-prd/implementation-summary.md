# Implementation Summary

**Timeline**: 2 weeks + 1 day (11 working days)
**Total Stories**: 21 stories across 5 epics
**Story Distribution**: Epic 1 (4 stories), Epic 2 (5 stories), Epic 3 (3 stories), Epic 4 (4 stories), Epic 5 (5 stories)

**Dependency Flow**:
```
Epic 1: Database Foundation & API Client (Days 1-2)
  ├─→ Epic 2: Incremental Sync & Processing (Days 3-5)
  │     └─→ Epic 3: Metadata-Enhanced Search (Days 6-7)
  └─→ Epic 4: Frontend UI & UX (Days 8-9)
          ↓
      Epic 5: Testing & Documentation (Day 10)
```

**Risk Mitigation Built Into Stories**:
- Every story includes Integration Verification steps ensuring existing system integrity
- Atomic chunk updates (Story 2.3) guarantee zero-downtime search availability
- Performance validation (Story 5.3) validates NFRs before production
- Comprehensive testing (Stories 5.1-5.2) validates all integration points

**Key Implementation Notes**:
1. **90% Code Reuse**: Stories 2.2, 2.5, 3.1 leverage existing services without modification
2. **Brownfield Safety**: All database changes additive (migration 010), existing tables unchanged
3. **Incremental Value**: Each epic delivers working functionality independently
4. **Metadata-First Search**: Story 3.1-3.2 implement mandatory metadata enrichment per requirements validation
