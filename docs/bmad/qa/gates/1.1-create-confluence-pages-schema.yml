nfr_validation:

    notes: 'RLS enabled with service role (write) and authenticated (read-only) policies. No SQL injection vectors. No sensitive data in metadata JSONB.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Migration executes <1s. Optimal index strategy: partial indexes for is_deleted, GIN jsonb_path_ops for JSONB, btree text_pattern_ops for hierarchy. No regressions detected.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Idempotent migration, CASCADE DELETE ensures consistency, soft delete preserves audit trail, FK constraint enforces referential integrity.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear SQL structure, comprehensive comments, follows established patterns (migration 008 RLS, self-recording), 100% test coverage.'

recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No immediate actions required
  future:
    - action: 'Consider adding performance benchmarks for large-scale deployments (10K+ pages)'
      refs: ['migration/0.1.0/010_add_confluence_pages.sql']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Current design supports 4000+ pages per requirements. Benchmarks would validate scaling to 10K+.'
    - action: 'Consider adding database migration rollback script for emergency use'
      refs: ['migration/0.1.0/010_add_confluence_pages.sql']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'While idempotent forward migration exists, explicit rollback would aid disaster recovery.'

strengths:
  - 'Exemplary test coverage: 21 tests across 12 categories with 100% pass rate'
  - 'Optimal index strategy: Partial indexes reduce size, GIN for JSONB containment, btree text_pattern_ops for path queries'
  - 'Comprehensive documentation: Table/column/index comments explain purpose and query patterns'
  - 'Proper idempotency: All DDL uses IF NOT EXISTS, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, DROP POLICY IF EXISTS'
  - 'Integration verification complete: CASCADE DELETE, existing functionality preservation validated'
  - 'Hybrid Schema correctly implemented: Metadata table + unified chunks for 90% code reuse'
