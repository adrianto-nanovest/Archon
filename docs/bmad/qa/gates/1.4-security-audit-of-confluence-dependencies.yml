schema: 1
story: "1.4"
story_title: "Security Audit of Confluence Dependencies"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Comprehensive security testing and documentation delivered, but critical CQL injection validation function exists only in test file and must be integrated into production code before Epic 2."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Critical issue requiring resolution before production
top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "CQL injection validation function (validate_space_key) exists in test file but not integrated into production code"
    location: "tests/security/test_confluence_cql_injection.py:25-61"
    impact: "Production code vulnerable to CQL injection attacks via unsanitized space_key parameters in confluence_client.py methods"
    suggested_action: "Extract validation function to python/src/server/utils/validation.py and integrate into API routes before Epic 2"
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  - id: "SEC-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "markdownify preserves javascript: protocol and data: URIs in Markdown link syntax"
    location: "tests/security/test_confluence_xss_prevention.py:86-133"
    impact: "LOW - Markdown not rendered to HTML currently, but residual XSS risk if future feature renders Markdown"
    suggested_action: "Monitor for future HTML rendering features; implement strip_unsafe_links() sanitization if needed"
    suggested_owner: "dev"

  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]  # ACs with full coverage

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Zero CVEs in dependencies, XSS tests passing (12/12), CQL tests passing (14/14) BUT validation function not integrated into production code. This is a production-blocking issue."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Test execution time: 0.19s (excellent fast feedback loop)"

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All validation functions raise clear ValueError with actionable error messages. No silent failures."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive 26-page security documentation with threat model and incident response plan. Test docstrings clear and well-structured."

# Risk summary
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 0  # Production-blocking issues (validation not integrated, but this is expected for audit story)
    high: 1      # CQL injection vulnerability in production code
    medium: 1    # XSS residual risk (documented, acceptable)
    low: 0

  highest:
    score: 9  # High severity (probability: 3, impact: 3)
    risk: "CQL injection vulnerability - validation function exists in test file only"
    mitigation: "Extract to production module and integrate into API/service layer"

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Extract validate_space_key() from test file to python/src/server/utils/validation.py"
      - "Integrate validation into all API routes accepting space_key parameter"
      - "Add integration tests verifying validation called in production code paths"

    monitor:
      - "XSS residual risk (javascript: protocol) - only issue if HTML rendering added"
      - "Page size limit (5MB max) - documented but not enforced yet"

# Recommendations with specific actions
recommendations:
  immediate:  # Must fix before Epic 2
    - action: "Create Epic 2 Story 0: 'Integrate CQL Injection Prevention' (P0 priority, 2-4 hour estimate)"
      refs:
        - "tests/security/test_confluence_cql_injection.py:25-61"
        - "python/src/server/services/confluence/confluence_client.py"
      rationale: "Validation logic complete and tested, but not callable from production code"

    - action: "Extract validate_space_key() to reusable utility module"
      refs:
        - "python/src/server/utils/validation.py (suggested location)"
      rationale: "Separate test code from production utilities for maintainability"

    - action: "Add validation calls to confluence_client.py methods: cql_search(), get_space_pages_ids()"
      refs:
        - "python/src/server/services/confluence/confluence_client.py"
      rationale: "Prevent CQL injection at service layer before API calls"

  future:  # Can be addressed in later releases
    - action: "Implement strip_unsafe_links() if HTML rendering feature added"
      refs:
        - "docs/bmad/confluence-security.md:222-230"
      rationale: "XSS residual risk documented; only relevant if Markdown rendered to HTML"

    - action: "Enforce 5MB max page size limit to prevent memory exhaustion"
      refs:
        - "docs/bmad/confluence-security.md:51-54"
      rationale: "Operational protection documented, defer to production hardening phase"

# Summary for executive review
summary:
  strengths:
    - "Exceptional test coverage with 26 passing security tests (0.19s execution)"
    - "Professional 26-page security documentation with threat model and incident response"
    - "Rigorous dependency audit with zero CVEs in Confluence-specific packages"
    - "Honest documentation of residual risks with clear impact analysis"

  concerns:
    - "CRITICAL: validate_space_key() function exists only in test file, not production code"
    - "MEDIUM: XSS residual risk (javascript: links) documented, acceptable for current use"

  recommendation_to_po:
    decision: "Accept Story 1.4 as complete (audit purpose achieved)"
    next_action: "Create Epic 2 Story 0 to integrate validation function (2-4 hours, P0)"
    rationale: "Story 1.4 delivered comprehensive security audit and test suite. Integration work logically belongs in Epic 2 (implementation phase)."
