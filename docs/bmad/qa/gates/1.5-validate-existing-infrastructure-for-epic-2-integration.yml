# Quality Gate Decision: Story 1.5
# Schema Version 1

schema: 1
story: "1.5"
story_title: "Validate Existing Infrastructure for Epic 2 Integration"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "All infrastructure validation tests pass (28/28), confirming 90% code reuse for Epic 2. However, CQL injection validation function from Story 1.4 must be integrated into production code before Epic 2 Story 2.1 implementation begins."

    notes: "CQL injection validation function exists in tests but NOT integrated into production code (CRITICAL). XSS residual risk documented (MEDIUM). All security tests passing (12/12 XSS, 14/14 CQL injection)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No performance concerns. Story validates existing infrastructure only (no new code). Document storage service tested with 1000+ word documents. Hybrid search source filtering validated. Progress tracker in-memory storage confirmed."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Atomic transaction rollback validated. CASCADE DELETE safety confirmed. Zero-downtime chunk replacement flow tested."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent test documentation. 891 lines of well-structured test code across 8 categories. Clear Given-When-Then patterns. Mock data matches PRD schema exactly."

# Decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Gate decision: CONCERNS (not FAIL or PASS)

  Rationale for CONCERNS:
  1. All 28 infrastructure validation tests pass successfully
  2. All 8 acceptance criteria fully met
  3. 90% code reuse confirmed - existing infrastructure ready for Epic 2
  4. Comprehensive test coverage across 8 categories (document storage, progress tracking, JSONB metadata, atomic updates, source isolation, CASCADE DELETE, transaction rollback, ETag caching)
  5. Integration verification tests (IV1-IV6) all passing

  However:
  - 1 CRITICAL security issue identified: CQL injection validation function from Story 1.4 exists in tests but NOT integrated into production code
  - This is an Epic 2 blocker (must be addressed before Story 2.1 implementation)
  - Issue severity = HIGH → Deterministic gate rule = CONCERNS

  Story 1.5 itself is complete and ready for "Done" status. The CONCERNS gate reflects a dependency on Story 1.4 security deliverable integration, which must be completed before Epic 2 proceeds.
