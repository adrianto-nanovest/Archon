# Quality Gate Decision: Story 2.1 - Core Infrastructure & Orchestrator

# Required fields
schema: 1
story: "2.1"
story_title: "Core Infrastructure & Orchestrator"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 7 acceptance criteria fully met with excellent implementation quality. All 26 tests passing (100% pass rate). Clean architecture with comprehensive error isolation, logging, and test coverage. Production-ready foundation for Stories 2.2-2.5."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns for orchestrator-only implementation. No user input handling. HTML parsing uses built-in html.parser. No network calls. Logging does not expose sensitive data."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient handler registration pattern. Empty handler registries in Story 2.1 = minimal overhead. BeautifulSoup operations scale linearly. No N+1 queries (clients passed to handlers for bulk operations in future stories)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error isolation with try-except at orchestrator level. Graceful degradation ensures failures in individual handlers don't crash conversion. All edge cases tested (empty HTML, failing handlers, pipeline order)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation with usage examples in base classes. Clean architecture with separation of concerns. Modern Python 3.12 syntax. Comprehensive test coverage (26 tests). Clear extension points for future stories."
