XSS Prevention Tests for Confluence HTML to Markdown Conversion

Tests that markdownify library safely converts potentially malicious Confluence
HTML content to Markdown without preserving executable code.

Test Coverage:
1. Script tag injection
2. Iframe injection
3. Object/Embed tags
4. Event handler injection (onclick, onerror)
5. JavaScript protocol in links
6. Base64 encoded scripts

Expected Behavior:
All malicious content should be stripped by markdownify, resulting in safe
Markdown output with no executable code.
